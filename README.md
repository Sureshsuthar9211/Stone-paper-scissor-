🪨📄✂️ Just Completed a Fun Mini Project: Stone-Paper-Scissors Game!
Excited to share that I’ve completed a mini project based on the classic Stone-Paper-Scissors game — blending simplicity, logic, and a touch of strategy into code! 🧠💻
🎯 Project Highlights:
Developed the game logic using HTML , CSS, JS.
Implemented user vs. computer interaction
Learned how even simple games can sharpen coding skills and logical thinking
This project reminded me how classic games can teach powerful lessons in programming, decision-making, and even user experience.
🔁 Small steps like these build strong foundations. Looking forward to leveling it up with more features — maybe even multiplayer or AI next?
